# Systolic-Array-Simulation
# Systolic Array Matrix Multiplication

This project simulates **matrix multiplication using a systolic array architecture** with time-step based computation logging.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- Simulates a **MxN systolic array** for matrix multiplication.
- Handles input matrices of dimensions `p × q` and `q × r`.
- Logs each **element-wise multiplication operation** at every time step.
- Generates an output file with results in the required format and naming convention.
